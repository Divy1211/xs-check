## Installation

You may download and use the prebuilt binaries from [here](https://github.com/Divy1211/xs-check/releases/latest)

Or instead, if you have rust installed and prefer to build it from source, you can simply run:

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/Divy1211/xs-check
```

This is recommended, as it will automatically add the binary to your system's path variable.

## Usage

Suppose you have an XS file like so:

`test.xs`
```cpp
void test(float f = 0.0) {
    int cp = xsGetContextPlayer();
    xsChatData("cp: %d", cp);
}

void test(float f = 0.0) {
    int b = "Oops";
}

void main() {
    test(1);

    float c = 4 + 5.5;
}
```

Invoke the binary on the file:

```sh
xs-check ./test.xs 
```

And it will generate an output with all the errors it finds:

![test.png](./imgs/test.png)

You may also tell it to ignore warnings (errors cannot be ignored) with a comma separated list:

```sh
xs-check file.xs --ignores warning1,warning2
```

The name used to ignore the warning is the same name that is printed in the first line of the warning. Ignoring the `DiscardedFn` warning may be useful at times

## Cool Maths
